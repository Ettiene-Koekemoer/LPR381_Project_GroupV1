# Operations Research Programming Project

## Introduction
Operations research is a scientific approach to decision making that seeks to best design and operate a system, under conditions requiring the allocation of scarce resources. This approach usually involves the use of one or more mathematical models. If the decision variables in an optimization model are always multiplied by constants and added together, the model is linear. If one or more decision variables must be integer, the optimization model is discrete or an integer model.

## Project Overview
This project involves creating a program that solves Linear Programming (LP) and Integer Programming (IP) models and analyzes how changes in an LPâ€™s parameters affect the optimal solution. The project should be built as a Visual Studio project using any .NET programming language. The final executable (solve.exe) should be menu-driven and meet the following criteria:

### Minimum Requirements
- Accept a random amount of decision variables.
- Accept a random amount of constraints.
- Use comments in the code.
- Implement programming best practices.

### Input Text File Criteria
- **First line**: Indicates if it is a maximization or minimization problem (max or min), followed by the objective function coefficients.
- **Constraints**: Each line specifies the coefficients for the decision variables, the relation used (e.g., =, <=, >=), and the right-hand side of the constraint.
- **Sign Restrictions**: Below all constraints, specify sign restrictions (+, -, urs, int, bin) in the same order as the objective function.
